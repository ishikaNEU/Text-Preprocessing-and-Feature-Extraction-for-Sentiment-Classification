# NLP Text Processing and Feature Extraction

## Overview
This project demonstrates various text processing techniques to clean and prepare text for downstream machine learning tasks such as sentiment classification. We apply tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and extract features using TF-IDF.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `src/`: Python scripts for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the pipeline.
- `results/`: Stores any model results and evaluations.

## Usage
1. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the full text preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline in action.
